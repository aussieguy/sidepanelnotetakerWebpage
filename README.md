# Side panel notetaker

Side panel notetaker lets you quickly create notes for each webpage.
These can then be saved and recalled so you are only looking at the notes you made for that website.
Other features like dark mode, copy to clipboard and text to speech are supported.

You can find this on the Chrome web store and a brief web version of this at
